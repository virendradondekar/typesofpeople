    <h3>The six personality types </h3>
    <p>According to researcher John Holland, six key categories define the modern worker. His assessment offers a
        framework that considers interest in career choice and pairs ideal environments for types of personalities that
        also play a role in job satisfaction and performance.
        <br>
        <br>

        The six types are Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional. The theory
        classifies people into their respective categories by evaluating how a person approaches life situations — and
        most people fall into more than one category. People with the same personality type tend to work best with
        others of their type, while certain types work best alone or with specific groups over others.
        <br>
        <br>

        Understanding the differences between the types, which tend to work best together, and the specific workplace
        environments that help them thrive can help workplace leaders from everything from hiring and desk assignments
        to layout and furniture decisions.
    </p>
    <h2><u>Realistic (Doer)</u></h2>
    <br>
    <p>Someone who likes to work mainly with their hands by making and fixing things, assembling operating equipment or
        using facility management software. They sometimes prefer working outdoors and find joy in a career that
        performs various manual labor. The Realistic individual works well with tools, machines, and mechanical
        drawings. Valuing practical things they can see and touch, they often see themselves as practical, mechanical,
        and goal oriented.</p>
    <br>
    <b>Best when working: Alone or with others in the Realistic category
        <br>

    </ol>
    <h2><u>Investigative (Thinker)</u> </h2>
    <br>
    <p>The most analytical of the six personalities, this detail-oriented group loves to study and solve math or
        science-related problems. They aren’t skilled negotiators but work best in a career choice that lets them work
        with others who are grounded. They see themselves as precise, intellectual, and goal-oriented people that like
        to be acknowledged for their achievements. </p>
    <br>
    <b>Best when working: Alone or with other investigative individuals
        <br>

    </ol>

    <h2><u>Artistic (Creator) </u></h2><br>
    <p>This group of individuals values others who are expressive and independent with an openness to experience. They
        naturally admire the creative arts, including writing and music, and have high levels of creativity. They see
        themselves as expressive and original and prefer to avoid a career choice that requires highly ordered or
        repetitive activities. They enjoy working in groups, but only if they are allowed expressive freedom and are
        encouraged to share their ideas. </p><br>
    <b>Best when working: In groups that allow creative expression and unsystematic teams <br><br>

        Compatible with: Investigative and Social <br><br>

        <li> Actor</li>



    </ol><br>
    <h2><u>Social (Helper) </u></h2><br>
    <p>Those with a Social personality type like to “dominate” their environment. This is the most common category of
        the six, and many people have traits of this category along with their others. They particularly value providing
        services for others and enjoy a career choice that enables them to workplace <a
            href="https://eptura.com/discover-more/blog/build-culture-of-collaboration-with-cmms-software/">closely with
            people</a> . Their ideal working
        conditions are with other people who are also trustworthy, helpful, and show appreciation. </p><br>

        <li> Nurse </li><br>
    </ol>
    <h2><u>Enterprising (Persuader)</u></h2><br>
    <p>Enterprising personalities are the people you want on your team when it comes to getting things done. They’re
        energetic, confident and assertive, and they don’t shy away from a challenge. They can be extroverted or
        introverted, but they all share some common traits: they’re ambitious, hard-working and willing to try new
        things. </p>
    <br>
    <b>Best when working: In groups and with all types of people in a leadership position
        <br><br>

        <br><br>

    <br><br>
    <ol>
        <li>Sales manager</li><br>

        <li>Attorney </li><br>
        <li>Hotel manager</li><br>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h2><u>Conventional (Organizer) </u></h2><br>
    <p>A member of this group would prefer a career choice where they can work with numbers, records, or machines.
        They enjoy repetitive tasks done in an orderly fashion and like to avoid ambiguous activities. They see
        themselves as organized and good at following directions. They value success in business and enjoy working
        with other people. However, they do best in small, systematic groups where they know their responsibilities.
    </p>

    <h2>How to match personality types and space planning</h2><br>
    <p>When planning your office’s environment, consider the six personality types and what they tend to prefer.
        <br><br>

        Artistic and Enterprising individuals are probably more drawn to a career choice in marketing and sales and
        would likely enjoy interacting if grouped together. So, make sure to have plenty of open spots where they
        can congregate and collaborate. <br><br>

        Be sure to give your Investigative and Realistic groups space to work alone but consider offering them
        smaller and private gathering spots to choose from if their tasks require them to work with others. <br><br>

        Your Conventional and Social departments — most likely those whose career choice is in HR and possibly
        security — should be placed where they’ll have lots of interaction with people and opportunities to help
        others. <br><br>

        Consider placing Conventional near your Artistic and Enterprising groups considering these individuals are
        likely to make a career choice that lets them enjoy working in teams. <br><br>

        In the age of the <a href="https://eptura.com/discover-more/blog/space-optimization-hybrid-workplace/">hybrid
            work model</a>, worktech that helps employees coordinate time in the office with others
        brings a lot of value. Employees can easily see who is going to be in the office on any given day, helping
        them match their schedules. And when the team needs a larger space to work, it’s easy for them to <a
            href="https://eptura.com/our-platform/workplace-experience-software/room-booking/">book a
            conference room</a> . <br><br>

        Taking it a step further, when looking into the design for your workplace, consider the career choice and
        types of environments each personality would thrive. For example, because they are prone to picking a career
        choice that involves working with varying groups of people, your Artistic and Enterprise groups most likely
        enjoy lots of colored and movable space so they can stretch their creative talents. However, your Realistic
        employees may prefer a quieter tone in their workspace to analyze data with <a
            href="https://eptura.com/discover-more/blog/workplace-analytics/">workplace analytics software</a> .
        <br><br>

        Knowing what works best for each personality and career choice is important — however, always remember that
        the best way to gauge what people want is to ask. During your next office renovation, for example, survey
        your employees to see what they want to see in the new workplace upgrade. With the right <a
            href="https://eptura.com/our-platform/workplace-experience-software/workplace-management-analytics/"> workplace management software</a>
       , you can review reliable occupancy and utilization data to see which spaces are most
        popular. From there, you can fine-tune your layouts to best meet the needs of your diverse workforce.
